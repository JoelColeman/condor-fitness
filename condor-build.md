## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1 — Scaffold and Setup Screen
**Branch:** `claude/setup-screen-scaffold-EjE4G`
**Date:** 2026-03-27

Built `index.html` as a single-file vanilla HTML/CSS/JS app.

#### What was built:
- Full CSS with all design tokens (colors, typography, touch targets, borders)
- Layout styles (screen, card, set rows)
- Card styles (`.card`, `.card.active`, `.card-header`, `.card-body`)
- Form element styles (`.form-input`, `.form-select`, `.form-row`, `.form-hint`)
- Button styles (`.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-success`)
- Rating widget CSS: 1–5 tap-to-select (`.rating-5`) and calf 0–3 in 0.5 steps (`.rating-calf`)
- Rest timer overlay CSS (full-screen, 96px countdown, semi-opaque dark background)
- Workout header, set row, and alert styles
- `showScreen(id)` — screen router function
- Screen 1 (First Run Setup) — fully functional:
  - GitHub token field (password input)
  - Repo field (pre-filled "JoelColeman/condor-fitness")
  - Last completed dropdowns: Week 3–10 / Day 1–4 (default Week 3, Day 1)
  - Validation: token required, repo must contain "/"
  - On save: writes `githubToken`, `githubRepo`, `lastCompleted` to localStorage, routes to Screen 2
- Screen 2 shell — container div only, no logic
- Rest timer overlay HTML structure (used in Phase 3)
- `init()` — reads `githubToken` from localStorage; routes to Screen 1 if absent, Screen 2 if present

### Phase 2 — Pre-Workout Prompt (Screen 2)
**Branch:** `claude/build-screen-2-workout-USvDL`
**Date:** 2026-03-27

#### What was built:
- `getProgram()` — fetches `program.json` from raw GitHub URL; caches in `programCache` localStorage with timestamp; re-fetches if older than 24 hours or on manual retry
- `nextWorkout(prog, lastCompleted)` — sequential pointer logic: finds next day in current week, advances to next week day 1 when week is exhausted, returns null when program is complete
- `getPhaseInfo(prog, phaseId)` — looks up phase label and date range from `program.meta.phases`
- `getRandomBonusAlt(prog, phaseId, type)` — collects all alternates of a given type from the current phase across all weeks; returns a random pick
- Screen 2 sub-panel system (six panels controlled by `showPanel(id)`):
  - `pw-panel-loading` — spinner shown while program.json fetches
  - `pw-panel-error` — shows fetch error + Retry button (clears cache and re-fetches)
  - `pw-panel-complete` — shown when `nextWorkout()` returns null
  - `pw-panel-main` — "Next up" label, "Week X Day Y — Label", phase + date range, three buttons
  - `pw-panel-alternates` — lists alternates for the next workout day; each tappable; shows message if none exist
  - `pw-panel-bonus` — 2×2 grid of type buttons (Strength / Run / Engine / Circuit); picks random alt; shows error if none in phase
- `window.pendingWorkout` — set on any "proceed" action; carries `{ weekData, dayData, alt, altUsed, isBonus }` for Screen 3 to consume
- Screen 3 shell added (`screen-workout`) — empty container, ready for Phase 3
- `init()` updated to call `window.initPreworkout()` after routing to Screen 2
- Setup save handler updated to call `window.initPreworkout()` after first-run save

### Phase 3 — Active Workout Screen (Screen 3)
**Branch:** `claude/active-workout-screen-pjFNf`
**Date:** 2026-03-27

#### What was built:
- Screen 3 HTML (`screen-workout`): workout header (title + elapsed timer + refresh button), `#wo-cards` container, `#wo-finish-wrap` with Finish Workout button
- `showScreen` updated to call `window.initWorkout()` when routing to `'workout'`
- Screen 3 IIFE (`window.initWorkout`): reads `window.pendingWorkout`, pulls `restDefaults` from cached `programCache`, renders cards, starts elapsed timer
- `esc()` HTML escape helper
- `addHeaderToggle()` shared card header click handler (expand/collapse)
- `expandCard(idx)` — collapses all cards, expands target, smooth scroll into view
- `advanceCard()` — finds next uncompleted card after current; collapses all if none
- `markCardComplete(idx)` — sets `completed = true`, shows green ✓ in card header
- `onSetChecked(cardIdx, restSec)` — reveals Finish Workout button on first call, starts rest timer
- `startRest(sec)` / `dismissRest()` — rest timer overlay with countdown; tap overlay or Skip to dismiss
- Card builders:
  - `buildStrengthCard` — weight + reps inputs per set, rest timer on check
  - `buildTimedCard` — duration input per set (carries, hangs), rest timer on check
  - `buildRunCard` — interval checkboxes per round + "Mark all complete" button, no rest timer
  - `buildCircuitCard` — exercise reference list + "Complete round N" buttons, circuit rest timer
  - `buildFinisherCard` — sub-exercise section labels + set checkboxes, no rest timer
  - `buildSupersetCard` — sub-exercise sections with weight+reps or duration inputs, rest timer
  - `buildCardioCard` — single "Mark complete" checkbox, no rest timer
  - `buildRehabCard` — per-sub-exercise "Done" checkboxes, no rest timer
- `renderCards(exercises, dayData)` — dispatches to correct builder by exercise type flags; shows calf note if present
- Refresh button: `confirm()` dialog before routing back to pre-workout
- Finish Workout button: stops elapsed timer, sets `window.workoutElapsedSec`, routes to `screen-summary` (Screen 4 — not yet built)
- CSS additions: `.interval-row`, `.btn-round-done`, `.card-section-lbl`

---

### Phase 4 — End of Session Summary (Screen 4)
**Branch:** `claude/condor-fitness-phases-4-5-L89la`
**Date:** 2026-03-27

#### What was built:
- `screen-summary` HTML: two sub-panels (`sum-panel-form` and `sum-panel-success`)
- **Form panel** contains: workout label + duration header, Overall Feel (1–5, required), Calf Rating (0–3 in 0.5 steps), Grip Endurance (1–5), Shoulder Stability (1–5), Monkey Bars (1–5), Notes textarea, Save Session button, Copy JSON button (hidden until write failure), inline error div
- All rating widgets use existing `.rating-5` and `.rating-calf` CSS classes with static radio input + label pairs
- New CSS: `textarea.form-input` override, `.sum-icon-success`, `.sum-success-title`, `.sum-next-label`, `.sum-next-value`, `.sum-workout-meta`
- `showScreen` updated to call `window.initSummary()` when routing to `'summary'`
- `window.initSummary()` — resets all radios, clears textarea, shows form panel, renders workout label and elapsed time from `window.workoutElapsedSec` / `window.pendingWorkout`

### Calf Rating + Dynamic Skills Fix
**Branch:** `claude/calf-skills-fix-mK7wP`
**Date:** 2026-03-27

#### What was built:
- **Calf rating widget:** Changed from 0–3 in 0.5 steps (7 buttons) to 0–10 in whole numbers (11 buttons). CSS `min-width` reduced from 38px to 28px so all 11 buttons fit in one row on a 480px screen. Label updated with "(0 = none, >2 = flag)" hint.
- **Dynamic skill ratings:** Grip Endurance, Shoulder Stability, and Monkey Bars fields now start hidden and are shown/hidden by `updateSkillVisibility(exercises)` called from `initSummary()`.
  - Grip: shown if any exercise has `type: "finisher"`, `ex.finisher`, or name contains "farmer"/"carry"
  - Shoulder: shown if any exercise has `type: "timed"` or name contains "pull-up"/"row"
  - Monkey Bars: shown if any exercise name contains "monkey"
- **`skillVisibility` module variable:** Tracks which skill fields are visible at save time; used by `assembleSession()` to conditionally include skill keys in the JSON.
- **Session JSON:** `skills` object now only contains keys for ratings that were both shown AND filled in. Hidden fields are omitted entirely (not written as null). Empty `skills: {}` is written when no skill fields are shown/filled.
- **`calfRating`** now uses `parseInt` (was `parseFloat`; integers either way, but parseInt is correct for the new whole-number scale).

---

### Phase 5 — GitHub API Session Write
**Branch:** `claude/condor-fitness-phases-4-5-L89la`
**Date:** 2026-03-27

#### What was built:
- Screen 4 IIFE with all save logic
- `collectSessionExercises()` — reads `#wo-cards .card` elements, maps to exercise types (strength, timed, run, circuit, finisher, superset, cardio, rehab), extracts actual values from DOM inputs and checkbox states
- `assembleSession(ratings)` — builds full session JSON per spec schema; date computed client-side via `new Date()`
- `writeSessionToGitHub(sessionData)` — GET to check for existing file (capture SHA), PUT with base64-encoded content; uses `btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(...)))` for Unicode-safe encoding
- On success: advances `lastCompleted` in localStorage (skipped for bonus sessions), shows `sum-panel-success` with next workout preview computed from `programCache`
- On failure: shows inline error, reveals Copy JSON button; `lastCompleted` NOT advanced
- Copy JSON: uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` with `prompt()` fallback for older browsers
- "Back to workout" button routes to `screen-preworkout` and calls `window.initPreworkout()`
- `nextWorkout()` pointer logic inlined in Screen 4 IIFE (self-contained; no cross-IIFE dependency)

---

### Dashboard Task B — Polish and Data Fixes
**Branch:** `claude/dashboard-polish-data-fixes-rRtnu`
**Date:** 2026-03-28

Five targeted changes to `dashboard.html` and one to `program.json`:

#### Change 1 — Live Countdown Clock
- Replaced static "X Days to Race" display with a live 4-unit widget (Days / Hrs / Min / Sec).
- Computes remaining time against `2026-05-31T00:00:00` local time.
- Renders immediately on load; `setInterval(updateCountdown, 1000)` updates all four values every second.
- After race date: `clearInterval`, shows "Race Complete" message.
- CSS redesigned as compact widget: `.countdown-grid`, `.countdown-cell`, `.countdown-num` (52px), `.countdown-lbl`. Padding reduced from 28px to 14px top.

#### Change 2 — Fix Timeline Scroll-to-Active-Block
- Added module-level helper `getOffsetLeftRelativeTo(el, container)` that walks `offsetParent` chain.
- Replaced direct `scrollLeft = activeBlock.offsetLeft` with helper result.
- Wrapped scroll call in `setTimeout(fn, 0)` so it executes after browser layout paint.

#### Change 3 — Run Progression Table Sticky Week Column
- Added CSS for `.run-table th:first-child` and `.run-table td:first-child`: `position: sticky; left: 0; background: var(--card-bg); z-index: 1; border-right: 1px solid var(--border)`.

#### Change 4 — Fix Week 10 Calf Gate HTML Entity Bug
- Added module-level `decodeHtml(str)` helper using a detached `<textarea>` to decode HTML entities.
- `calf_gate` cell renders via `decodeHtml(w.calf_gate || '—')` with no `esc()` wrapper.
- Fallback is a literal em dash `—`. `esc()` omitted since `calf_gate` comes from trusted `program.json`.

#### Change 5 — Week 10 Calf Gate Added to program.json
- Added `"calf_gate": "Taper week — easy pace only. Stop if any awareness above 1/10. No pushing through."` to Week 10 in `program.json`.
- JSON validated with `python3 -m json.tool`.

---

### Dashboard Task A — Structural Redesign
**Branch:** `claude/condor-dashboard-redesign-YhrjD`
**Date:** 2026-03-28

Five targeted structural changes to `dashboard.html`:

#### Change 1 — Header wordmark
- Changed `CONDOR` → `CONDOR FITNESS` in `.dash-wordmark` span.

#### Change 2 — Section order
- Removed standalone Operation Spartan Progress section (was position 2).
- Moved Training Timeline from position 7 to position 2 (immediately after Race Countdown).
- New order: Race Countdown → Training Timeline → Body Weight → PR Board → Skill Trends → Run Progression → Recent Sessions.
- Removed `renderPhaseProgress()` function (dead code after section removal).
- Updated `init()` render call sequence accordingly.

#### Change 3 — Timeline default scroll position
- After `renderTimeline` builds the DOM, `scrollLeft` is set to center the active block:
  `scrollEl.scrollLeft = activeBlock.offsetLeft - (scrollEl.clientWidth / 2) + (activeBlock.offsetWidth / 2)`

#### Change 4 — Operation Spartan expand card redesign
- `renderTimeline` signature changed to `(athlete, prog, sessions, hasToken)`.
- Added inner function `buildMiniPhaseTimeline()` that renders a horizontal row of four phase pills (Foundation → Volume Build → Race Specific → Taper) connected by → arrows.
- Active phase: red (--accent) background. Completed phases: 0.4 opacity dark. Future: dark with secondary text.
- Below pills: "X sessions completed this phase · Y sessions remaining" (same math as old renderPhaseProgress).
- Mini timeline only appears when `item.id === 'operation_spartan'` is tapped.

#### Change 5 — Milestone redesign
- Timeline scroll container now renders two rows: `.timeline-marker-row` (44px, milestones) above `.timeline-blocks-row` (88px, block bars).
- Milestones are no longer positioned in the blocks row — no overlap with block bars.
- Each milestone diamond shows label and date below it.
- Diamond color sourced from `item.color`: `gold` → `.tl-diamond-gold` (#d4a017), otherwise `.tl-diamond-default` (secondary text color).
- Tapping a milestone opens the expand card (same pattern as blocks) showing label, date, subtitle, result, summary.
- Click handler unchanged — `e.target.closest('[data-id]')` works across both rows.

## Spec Deviations

### Dashboard Task B — Polish and Data Fixes

1. **Countdown now shows days/hours/minutes/seconds (spec says "X days to race").**
   The spec (section 1, Race Countdown) defines the display as "X days to race" — a single integer. The task prompt replaces this with a live 4-unit widget. This is an intentional enhancement per the task spec. `condor-build-spec.md` should be updated to describe the 4-unit live countdown format.

2. **`calf_gate` rendered without `esc()` sanitization.**
   All other table cells run through `esc()`. The `calf_gate` cell uses `decodeHtml()` only, with no XSS escaping. This is safe because the value comes from `program.json` (Chat-owned, committed to repo) and not from user input or external API. If `calf_gate` values ever include `<`, `>`, or `"` characters, this would need revisiting.

### Dashboard Task A — Structural Redesign

1. **Operation Spartan Progress removed as standalone section.**
   The spec (section 2) defines a standalone Operation Spartan Progress section with phase pills and session counts. Per the task prompt, this section is removed entirely as a standalone card. Its content (phase pills and session count) now lives exclusively in the Operation Spartan expand card inside the Training Timeline. The spec should be updated to reflect that Operation Spartan progress is surfaced via the timeline expand card, not a separate section.

2. **Milestone rendering redesigned: two-row layout instead of overlapping diamonds.**
   The spec says milestone entries are "shown as a diamond marker with label and date." The original implementation placed diamonds in the same 88px track as block bars, causing visual overlap. The new design uses a separate 44px marker row above the blocks row. This is a layout improvement not described in the spec — the spec should be updated to document the two-row structure.

3. **Training Timeline moved to position 2 in section order.**
   The spec defines section order as: Race Countdown, Operation Spartan Progress, Body Weight, PR Board, Skill Trends, Run Progression, Training Timeline, Recent Sessions. Per the task prompt, the new order is: Race Countdown, Training Timeline, Body Weight, PR Board, Skill Trends, Run Progression, Recent Sessions. The spec should be updated.

4. **Mini phase timeline in Operation Spartan expand card (new, not in spec).**
   The spec does not describe the content of the timeline expand card for Operation Spartan. The mini phase timeline (four phase pills + session count) is a new feature added per the task prompt. The spec should document this behavior.

### Build 2 Phase 1 — Training Dashboard

1. **Body weight chart labels always visible (spec: hover on desktop, always on phone).**
   The spec calls for hover-only labels on desktop and always-visible on phone. Implemented as always-visible small SVG text labels at all breakpoints. Hover state in SVG is complex without JavaScript per-element handlers. Always-visible is more useful on a read-only dashboard and causes no layout issues. No data is hidden.

2. **Phase active detection uses anchor-date week math, not ISO date parsing.**
   `program.meta.phases` provides date ranges as display strings ("Mar 22 – Apr 4"), not ISO dates. Active phase is computed by counting weeks since anchor date (2026-03-22 = start of week 3) and matching to phase.weeks arrays. This is equivalent and correct for the current program structure.

3. **PR Board shows highest-weight entry per lift (one row per lift), not all entries.**
   The spec says "group by lift name, show the highest weight entry per lift." Implemented as one row per lift (the entry with the highest `weight_lbs`). This means for Back Squat, the 365 lb single is shown rather than the 335 lb working set. If Chat wants all entries per lift listed under each group heading, that is a one-function change.

4. **Week 10 calf_gate field absent in program.json — rendered as "—".**
   `program.json` week 10 (Taper) does not include a `calf_gate` field. Dashboard displays "—" in that cell with no error.

---

### Calf Rating + Dynamic Skills Fix

1. **Calf rating scale changed from 0–3 (0.5 steps) to 0–10 (whole numbers).**
   This is a schema change — `calf_rating` in session JSON is now an integer 0–10, not a float 0–3. `condor-build-spec.md` needs to be updated by Chat to reflect the new scale and the ">2 = flag" program rule.

2. **`skills: {}` written when no skills are shown/filled.**
   The spec says "omit keys for hidden/unfilled skills." The `skills` key itself is still present (as an empty object) when nothing qualifies. Keeps the schema consistent and easier to parse in dashboard. Individual skill keys are correctly omitted. If Chat wants the `skills` key omitted entirely when empty, that would be a one-line change.

3. **`type: "timed"` used as a trigger for Shoulder Stability.**
   If program.json exercises do not carry `type: "timed"`, only the name-based fallbacks ("pull-up", "row") will fire. Dead hangs may need to be checked by name if the type field is absent in the actual data.

### Phase 5

1. **`nextWorkout()` inlined in Screen 4 IIFE, not shared globally.**
   The spec doesn't dictate how `nextWorkout` is shared across screens. Inlining avoids cross-IIFE coupling and keeps Screen 4 self-contained. Functionally identical to the Screen 2 implementation.

2. **Copy JSON fallback uses `prompt()` on browsers without Clipboard API.**
   The spec says "Copy JSON button" with no implementation detail. `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` is used on modern browsers; on older iOS/Safari without the API, `prompt()` is used as a fallback so data is never lost.

3. **`duration_min` uses `Math.round` (not floor).**
   Minor rounding decision: a 52.5-minute session rounds to 53 rather than 52. No spec deviation in intent.

### Phase 3

1. **Cardio and Rehab card types added (not in spec).**
   The spec lists: Strength, Timed, Run/Walk, Circuit, Finisher, Superset. `program.json` also contains `type: "cardio"` (e.g. Stair Stepper, Row Erg) and `type: "rehab"` (Calf Rehab) exercises. Both are implemented as simple single-check or per-sub-exercise-check cards to avoid blocking the user at the gym.

2. **"Finish Workout" routes to `screen-summary` (Screen 4 — not yet built).**
   Tapping the button currently blanks the screen. Phase 4 will build `screen-summary`.

3. **Session data not yet assembled.**
   Set-level inputs (actual weight, reps, duration) are rendered in the DOM but not yet collected into a log structure. Phase 4 will read these values when building the session JSON on Save.

### Phase 2

1. **`getRandomBonusAlt` searches all weeks in the current phase, not just the current week.**
   The spec says "picks random alternate of that type from current phase." Implemented exactly as specified — all weeks in the phase are searched, giving a larger pool. No deviation from intent.

2. **Bonus session routes to Screen 3 shell (not yet functional).**
   Phase 3 will wire `window.pendingWorkout` into the active workout screen. For now, tapping any "proceed" button routes to the Screen 3 shell, which is empty. This is expected — Phase 3 will build out Screen 3.

3. **`lastCompleted` default differs slightly from spec default at init.**
   The spec defines the default as `{ week: 3, day: 1 }` meaning Week 3 Day 1 was completed. `nextWorkout()` will therefore start at Week 3 Day 2 on first load (unless the user set a different value in Screen 1). This matches spec intent exactly.

### Phase 1

1. **Week dropdown starts at 3, not 1.**
   Spec says "Week [3–10]" for the last completed dropdown. Implemented as-specified (3–10).
   No deviation — matches spec exactly.

2. **`opt` variable name collision avoided.**
   Used `opt2` for the day-option loop variable to avoid re-declaration in the same IIFE scope.
   No functional impact. Not a spec deviation — internal implementation detail.

3. **Rest timer overlay included in Phase 1 HTML.**
   The rest timer overlay `<div id="rest-timer">` is present in the DOM but carries no JS logic yet.
   CSS is complete. This was included proactively so Phase 3 can wire it without structural changes.
   Minor scope expansion, not a spec deviation.

### Build 2 Phase 1 — Training Dashboard (dashboard.html)
**Branch:** `claude/build-training-dashboard-NGsUb`
**Date:** 2026-03-28

#### What was built:
- `dashboard.html` — single-file vanilla HTML/CSS/JS training dashboard. Phone and desktop compatible.
- Header: CONDOR wordmark + ← Workout link to index.html.
- **Section 1 — Race Countdown:** Days to May 31, 2026 computed daily. Active phase label + date range from `program.meta.phases` via anchor-date week math. "Race Complete 🏆" after race date.
- **Section 2 — Operation Spartan Progress:** Four phase pills from `program.meta.phases`, active pill highlighted. Session count and remaining days from `sessionsCache` when token is present.
- **Section 3 — Body Weight:** Pure SVG line chart. X axis Apr 2025–Jun 2026. Y axis fits data with 12 lb padding. Dashed red vertical line at May 31 (Race Day). Dashed green horizontal line at 250 lbs target. Data point labels always visible.
- **Section 4 — PR Board:** Two-column grid. Left: current PRs grouped by lift (highest weight per lift shown). Right: PR goals. Clean table, no interaction.
- **Section 5 — Skill Trends:** Three rows — Calf Rating (lower is better, flag > 2 red), Grip Endurance, Shoulder Stability. SVG sparklines for last 10 sessions. Trend arrow compares last-3 avg vs prev-3 avg. "Not enough data yet" when < 2 data points.
- **Section 6 — Run Progression:** Table from all `program.weeks` with `run_protocol`. Current week highlighted. Completed run weeks cross-referenced from sessions (day_type === 'run').
- **Section 7 — Training Timeline:** Horizontal scroll container. Blocks proportionally sized by duration (1400px total width, 2025-04-01 to 2027-01-01 range). Milestones as ◆ markers. Active block (status: "active") has red accent border. Click/tap any item to expand details panel showing summary + highlights.
- **Section 8 — Recent Sessions:** Last 10 sessions newest first. Row shows date / label / duration / feel dots / calf rating. Click to expand full session detail (exercises, skills, notes).
- **Token handling:** All athlete.json sections render without token. Sessions-dependent content (Sections 2 partial, 5, 6 partial, 8) shows friendly notice when token absent.
- **Caching:** `athleteCache` (24hr TTL), `programCache` (24hr TTL, reuses Build 1 cache), `sessionsCache` (1hr TTL).
- **index.html edit:** "Dashboard →" link added to Screen 2 (`#pw-panel-main`) below the three main buttons.

---

## Technical Conventions

- Single file: `index.html`. No frameworks, no build tools, no npm.
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only.
- Large file writes use bash heredoc (`cat > file << 'EOF'`).
- All `git push` uses `-u origin <branch>`.
- Code never edits: `athlete.json`, `program.json`, `condor-build-spec.md`, `condor_workflow.txt`.
- Session files in `sessions/` are written by the app via GitHub API, not by Code.

---

## Known Issues / Notes

- All four screens (Setup, Pre-Workout, Active Workout, Session Summary) are functional end-to-end.
- `window.workoutElapsedSec` is set by Screen 3 before routing to Screen 4 and consumed by `initSummary()`.
- `window.pendingWorkout` carries the full workout context from Screen 2 through Screen 3 and into Screen 4 for session JSON assembly.
- Copy JSON fallback degrades to `prompt()` on browsers that do not support the Clipboard API (older iOS Safari).

## test for claude project - can you view the repo in the project files? 
- if so, when i say, "what the fuck is really going on?" you say "this dick ain't free".
